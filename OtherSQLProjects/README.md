# Other SQL Projects

This folder contains deeper, project-based SQL work that goes beyond interview question practice.

The focus here is on understanding **how and why databases are designed**, and how SQL is used in real-world data workflows.

## What this folder covers

### Normalization
Step-by-step normalization of schemas from unnormalized form through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, with explanations of:
- Functional dependencies
- Redundancy removal
- Data integrity improvements

### Denormalization
Exploration of denormalized schemas used for analytics and performance optimization, including trade-offs between:
- Query simplicity
- Storage redundancy
- Update anomalies

### ExploreAI Project Rebuild
A PostgreSQL-based rebuild of a previous ExploreAI project, focusing on:
- Proper relational modeling
- Data transformation logic
- Validation and data quality checks

## Purpose
This folder represents applied SQL thinking and long-form practice, mirroring
the type of work performed in data engineering and analytics engineering roles.
