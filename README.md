# My SQL Environment

This repository serves as my personal SQL environment, containing everything related to SQL practice, experimentation, and project work on my local machine.

The goal of this project is to:
- Master core SQL patterns commonly tested in interviews
- Practice schema design, normalization, and denormalization
- Build confidence explaining SQL decisions clearly and concisely
- Use PostgreSQL as an industry-standard relational database

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL
- VS Code
- SQL

## Repository Structure

### InterviewPrep/
Focused, pattern-based SQL practice aligned with technical interviews.
Includes a reusable core schema, categorized problem sets, and minimal schemas for specialized SQL topics.

### OtherSQLProjects/
Deeper SQL projects exploring:
- Database normalization (1NF → 3NF)
- Denormalization for performance
- Rebuilding real-world data projects in PostgreSQL

Each section includes documentation explaining design decisions and trade-offs.

## How I Practice
- Reuse a core schema for 60–70% of interview questions
- Create minimal schemas only when necessary
- Focus on clarity, correctness, and explanation — not memorization
