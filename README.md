# My SQL Environment

This repository serves as my personal SQL environment — a centralized space for **SQL practice, experimentation, mini projects, and professional preparation**.

The goal of this project is to:

- Master core SQL patterns commonly tested in interviews
- Practice schema design, normalization, and denormalization
- Build confidence explaining SQL decisions clearly and concisely
- Explore applied data engineering concepts such as **ETL workflows and data integration**

## Tech Stack

This repository demonstrates experience working with:

- **PostgreSQL** (industry‑standard relational database)
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (for ETL and integration practice)
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** for data pipelines and ETL
- **VS Code**, **Visual Studio / SSDT**
- **SQL**

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized into focused folders that separate core skill practice from deeper applied projects:

### 🧠 `InterviewPrep/`

Focused, pattern‑based SQL practice aligned with technical interviews.  
Includes a reusable core schema, categorized problem sets, and minimal schemas for specialized SQL topics.

### 🔁 `OtherSQLProjects/`

Deeper SQL projects exploring:

- Database normalization (1NF → 3NF)
- Denormalization for performance
- Rebuilding real‑world data projects in PostgreSQL

Each section includes documentation explaining design decisions and trade‑offs.

### 🚀 `MiniProjects/`

Applied SQL and data engineering explorations, including:

- **SSIS Sales Data Consolidation** – An end‑to‑end ETL pipeline using SSIS to ingest, transform, and load sales data from multiple sources into a SQL Server table.  
  This project demonstrates how relational SQL skills can be extended to real, production‑like workflows.

> MiniProjects are designed to showcase cross‑cutting skills:  
> applied SQL, ETL logic, data movement, transformation, and documentation.

## How I Practice

My approach to practicing SQL and data engineering includes:

- **Structured drills:** Pattern‑based questions from InterviewPrep to build fluency
- **Project‑oriented work:** Deeper challenges in OtherSQLProjects to understand design principles
- **Applied pipelines:** End‑to‑end ETL & integration work in MiniProjects to bridge SQL with real data engineering tools beyond just querying
- **Documentation and reflection:** Each project includes clear README documentation outlining:
  - Problem statement
  - Technical approach
  - Challenges and lessons learned
  - Screenshots / diagrams

This helps me prepare for real‑world scenarios and communicate technical decisions clearly — both in interviews and in professional settings.
