# Interview SQL Practice

This folder contains structured SQL practice designed specifically for software engineering and data engineering interviews.

## Focus Areas
- Joins and anti-joins
- Aggregations and HAVING
- Subqueries and EXISTS
- Window functions
- Edge cases and NULL handling

A single reusable core schema is used for the majority of problems to reinforce
pattern recognition over memorization.
